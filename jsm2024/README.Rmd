`jsm2024` is an R package with all the JSM talks.  It makes personalized recommendations for talks (based on citation network data) and exports your schedule as an ical file that can be loaded into Google Calendar and similar.

### Getting started

To install the package:

```{r, eval = FALSE}
remotes::install_github("jacobbien/jsm2024-project", subdir = "jsm2024")
```
 
An example of the sort of thing you can do with the package:

```{r}
# which of my co-authors are at JSM?
my_coauthors <- jsm2024::get_coauthors("Jacob Bien")

# which of the people I cite the most are at JSM?
people_cited_by_me <- jsm2024::get_out_citations("Jacob Bien")

# which of the people who cite me the most are at JSM?
people_citing_me <- jsm2024::get_in_citations("Jacob Bien")

# when are their talks?
schedule <- jsm2024::get_talks(
  speakers = c(my_coauthors, people_cited_by_me[1:8], people_citing_me[1:8]),
  session_types = "Paper",
  days = c("2024-08-05", "2024-08-06", "2024-08-07")
)
```

This produces a data frame of talks:

```{r}
dplyr::select(schedule, speaker, title)
```


See `?get_talks` for the other ways you can filter talks.  Finally, you can export this in the ical format, which can be imported into Google Calendar and other standard calendars:

```{r}
jsm2024::export_calendar_to_ics(schedule, file = "jsm-talks.ics")
```

Once imported into Google Calendar, we get the following:

### About

[We](http://faculty.marshall.usc.edu/jacob-bien/) wrangled decades of citation and coauthorship data from Semantic Scholar and arxiv to form these recommendations.  Special thanks to [Donna LaLonde](https://www.linkedin.com/in/donna-lalonde-she-her-a6a41124) and [Ronald Wasserstein](https://www.amstat.org/about-asa/ronald-l-wasserstein) this year for providing JSM program information.  We have also included functionality for exporting your schedule as an ical that can be loaded into Google Calendar or similar. The result is a package that streamlines the process of finding talks that you may want to attend.  The first version of this was done as a web app for JSM 2019 with [Ronak Upadhyaya](https://ronakupadhyaya.github.io/) and the [second version](https://github.com/jacobbien/jsm2022-project/tree/main/jsm2022), for JSM 2022, was done with [Yibin Xiong](https://www.linkedin.com/in/yibin-xiong-936b64204/).  `jsm2024` was written using literate programming.  In particular, the entire package was generated by "litr-knitting" [a single Rmd file](https://jacobbien.github.io/jsm2024-project/create-jsm2024.html).  To learn more about the `litr` package and the literate programming approach to writing R packages, see [here](https://jacobbien.github.io/litr-project/).
